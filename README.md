# Fashion_Mnist_Classifier


This is basic ML model that takes the training data set from the new fashion_Mnist data set and then uses
their testing data to make predictions 
This is the link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist

I use a a Convolutional Nueral Network (CNN) for the hidden layers


The training csv was over 25 megabytes, so it could not upload to the repository, so just download the training data from the link
above
